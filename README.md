## What is it?



# IMPORTANT!
  To ship the game: 
  In Cmakelists.txt, set the PRODUCTION_BUILD flag to ON to build a shippable version of your game. This will change the file paths to be relative to your exe (RESOURCES_PATH macro), will remove the console, and also will change the asserts to not allow people to debug them. To make sure the changes take effect I recommend deleting the out folder to make a new clean build!


  Also, if you read the CMAKE, even if you don't know CMAKE you should understand what happens with the comments there and you can add libraries and also remove the console from there if you need to! (there is a commented line for that!)
